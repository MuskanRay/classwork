    <h2>What is Air Pollution?</h2>
    <p> Air pollution refers to any physical, chemical or biological change in the air. It is the contamination of air by harmful gases, dust and smoke which affects plants, animals and humans drastically.</p>
    <p>There is a certain percentage of gases present in the atmosphere. An increase or decrease in the composition of these gases is harmful to survival. This imbalance in the gaseous composition has resulted in an increase in earth’s temperature, which is known as global warming.
      Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to adverse effects on human health, wildlife, and the overall environment. These pollutants can be either natural or man-made and are typically in the form of gases, particulate matter, or biological molecules.

    <h2>Types of Air Pollution</h2>
    <p>There are two types of air pollutants:</p>
    <h3>Primary Pollutants</h3>
    <p>The pollutants that directly cause air pollution are known as primary pollutants. Sulphur-dioxide emitted from factories is a primary pollutant.</p>
    <h3>Secondary Pollutants</h3>
    <p>The pollutants formed by the intermingling and reaction of primary pollutants are known as secondary pollutants. Smog, formed by the intermingling of smoke and fog, is a secondary pollutant.</p>

    <h2>Common Air Pollutants:</h2>
    <p><b>Particulate Matter (PM)</b>: Tiny particles suspended in the air, including dust, dirt, soot, and liquid droplets. PM can have various sizes, and smaller particles (PM2.5 and PM10) can penetrate deep into the lungs.</p>

    <p> <b> Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)</b>: Gases produced by combustion processes, such as those in vehicles and industrial facilities. NOx contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and particulate matter.</p>
      
     <p><b> Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)</b>: A gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels containing sulfur. SO2 can lead to respiratory problems and contribute to the formation of acid rain.</p>
      
     <p><b>Ozone (O3)</b>: A gas that forms when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, and other sources react chemically in the presence of sunlight. While ozone high in the atmosphere protects us from the sun's ultraviolet rays, ground-level ozone can cause respiratory issues.</p>
      
     <p><b> Carbon Monoxide (CO)</b>: A colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. High levels of CO can be harmful, particularly in enclosed spaces.</p>
      
     <p><b> Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</b>: Organic chemicals that can evaporate into the air, contributing to air pollution. Sources include vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and household products.</p>

      <h2>Effects of Air Pollution:</h2>
      
      <p><b>Respiratory Issues</b>: Exposure to air pollutants can lead to respiratory problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases.</p>
      
     <p><b> Cardiovascular Effects</b>: Long-term exposure to air pollution is linked to cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes.</p>
      
      <p><b>Environmental Impact</b>: Air pollution can harm ecosystems, soil, water bodies, and wildlife. It contributes to acid rain, damages vegetation, and affects aquatic life.</p>
      
     <p><b> Climate Change</b>: Certain air pollutants, like greenhouse gases, contribute to climate change by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>Tips to Control Air Pollution</h2>
    <p><b>Reducing Emissions</b>: Implementing and enforcing strict emission standards for industries, vehicles, and power plants</p>
    <p><b>Promoting Clean Energy</b>: Encouraging the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
    <p><b>Public Awareness</b>: Educating the public about the sources and effects of air pollution and promoting sustainable practices.</p>
    <p><b>Afforestation</b>: Planting trees and creating green spaces to absorb pollutants and improve air quality.</p>

      <cite>--Malin Eriksen</cite><br>
      <p>Breathe in and breathe out. <br> 
        Can´t live without it<br>
          <br>
        With every cigarette you smoke, you take part in killing a stranger.<br>
        With every car you start, you take part in destroying the last bit of fresh air.<br>
        <br>
        Where are the birds that used to fly,<br>
        Where are the fish that used to swim,<br>
        Where are the children that used to play?<br>
        One day we will wish there was a clock whose hands we could rewind.<br>
        To the time, when it still was not "too late"<br>
        <br>
        Now, at this very second, is the time to finally realize,<br>
        what it´s all truly worth.<br>
        Let´s not be the generation who "could" have made a change<br>
        <br>
        Breathe in and breathe out.  <br>
        Remember that you can´t live without it<br></p>
